OK here's what happened... I used every single type of data structure in this
problem.  I regret this decision very very much.  But I am proud to say, despite
costing me untold hours, it was born of pure laziness:  My DICTIONARY in
dictionary_tools.rb was copy and pasted more or less from online.

In any case here's what we have:

lib:
  dictionary_tools contains methods and dictionarys used by reader and writer classes
  night_writer_2 contains the NightWriter2 class code
  night_reader_2 contains the NightReader2 class code
  file_reader_writer contains the FileReadWriter class for reading and writing to files
  night_write_executable contains the code which actually writes to file braille.text
  night_read_exectuable contains the code which actually writes to file text.txt

test:
  contains tests for all methods
